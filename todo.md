# Todo

- [ ] rename JsonPath to just Path
  - when application/xml would be supported, JsonPath would be misleading
- [x] support for OpenTelemetry metrics
- [x] at the moment only support the following based ContentTypes:
  - application/text
  - application/json
  - multipart/form-data
- [x] improved docs / man
- [ ] support colored Console Logger based on log-levels with Serilog instead of custom ConsoleHelper
