# Todo

- [ ] somehow find a way to reference file paths in Test Case definitions relative to the location of the test-case file
- [ ] rename JsonPath to just Path
  - when application/xml would be supported, JsonPath would be misleading
- [ ] at the moment only support the following based ContentTypes:
  - application/json
  - application/octet-stream
- [ ] support file uploads via multipart/form-data
- [ ] support file downloads
  - application/octet-stream via Content-Disposition header
